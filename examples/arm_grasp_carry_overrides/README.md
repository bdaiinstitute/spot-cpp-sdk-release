# ARM GRASP CARRY OVERRIDES

This example program sets arm grasp state and carry state overrides while moving the arm around. It demonstrates how to initialize the SDK to talk to the robot and how to command Spot to stand up and
move the arm.

## Run the Example

To run the example, set BOSDYN_CLIENT_USERNAME and BOSDYN_CLIENT_PASSWORD environment variables with the robot credentials and then run:

```
./arm_grasp_carry_overrides {ROBOT_IP}
```
