# C++ SDK

The C++ SDK is used by C++ applications to control Spot, read sensor information, and register payload services.

## Using the C++ SDK

The [C++ QuickStart](quickstart.md) is the recommended way to get started using the C++ SDK. It is a step-by-step guide that will help you compile and install the C++ libraries you need and run simple programs to control Spot.

[Understanding Spot programming](https://dev.bostondynamics.com/docs/python/understanding_spot_programming) goes deeper than the QuickStart and covers some of the key concepts of developing applications for Spot. That document is Python-centric, but most concepts apply to the C++ SDK.

[Differences in C++ SDK from Python SDK](cpp_sdk_differences.md) describes the key differences in the Spot C++ SDK from the Spot Python SDK. This is a useful article for users familiar with the Spot Python SDK who would like to use the C++ version.

The [C++ example programs](../../cpp/examples/README.md) demonstrate how to use the C++ library, and can be used as reference programs for your own applications.

The [C++ reference guide](../../cpp/README.md) documents all of the C++ classes and interfaces in detail.

### Supported platforms and versions

The C++ SDK is supported on the following platforms:

- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Windows 10
- MacOS 10.14 (Mojave and Catalina)
